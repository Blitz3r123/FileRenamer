I don't like renaming files on Windows so I created my own one.

# How to Use
1. Pick a folder
2. The software will list all the file names as inputs
3. Change your file name and then hit Enter
4. Your file has now been renamed (INCLUDING THE FILE EXTENSION IF YOU REMOVED THAT BY ACCIDENT)
5. Enjoy your new file names
